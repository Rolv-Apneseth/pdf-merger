# rolvs-pdf-merger
 Simple program to merge pdf files together, with a gui made in pyqt5.

Run the main.py file for a gui, which allows you to add (even add all .pdf files from a chosen directory) and remove pdf files from the list displayed,
and select which folder the merged file will be output to.

Or you can run the pdf_merger_script in the command line, giving the pdf file full path names (remember to switch \ for / as a \ will cause errors in python) as arguments,
or give argument "all" to merge all pdfs in the current working directory.
